## 📋 To Enable Email Automation

### Step 1: Set Up Email Integration

You can use one of these email services:
- **Resend** (recommended for developers)
- **SendGrid** (enterprise-grade)
- **Gmail** (for basic needs)

### Step 2: Update Email Sending Function

In `server/utils/emailReports.ts`, the `sendDailyReportEmail` function needs to be updated to actually send emails using your chosen integration.

Example with Resend:
```typescript
import { Resend } from 'resend';
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function sendDailyReportEmail(recipientEmail: string) {
  const reportData = await generateDailyReportData();
  const htmlContent = formatDailyReportHTML(reportData);
  
  const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'reports@yourdomain.com',
    to: recipientEmail,
    subject: `Daily Business Report - ${reportData.date}`,
    html: htmlContent,
  });
  
  if (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
  
  return { success: true };
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Automated Daily Sending

#### Option A: Using Replit Cron (Recommended)
Create a scheduled deployment that runs daily:
1. Go to Replit Deployments
2. Add a scheduled task
3. Set it to run daily at your preferred time
4. Configure it to call `/api/reports/email/send`

#### Option B: Using Node-Cron
Add to your server startup:
```typescript
import cron from 'node-cron';

// Run daily at 8 AM
cron.schedule('0 8 * * *', async () => {
  await sendDailyReportEmail('admin@example.com');
});
```
