## Technical Implementation

### Backend APIs Used
All reports use existing backend endpoints with proper authentication and role-based access:

```
GET /api/reports/sales?startDate=<date>&endDate=<date>&period=<daily|monthly>
GET /api/reports/inventory
GET /api/reports/top-products?limit=<number>
GET /api/reports/employee-performance
```

### Data Flow
1. User selects a time period
2. Frontend calculates date range
3. React Query fetches data from backend
4. MongoDB aggregation pipelines process data
5. Real-time results displayed in UI
6. Loading skeletons shown during fetch
7. Export generates JSON files on demand

### Role-Based Access
Reports are protected by permissions:
- **Admin**: Full access to all reports
- **HR Manager**: Full access to all reports
- Other roles: Limited based on ROLE_PERMISSIONS

## How to Use

### Accessing Reports
